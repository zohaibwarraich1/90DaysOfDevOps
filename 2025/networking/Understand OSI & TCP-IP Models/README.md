# OSI & TCP/IP Models Explained 🚀

## Understanding the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model** and **TCP/IP Model** is crucial for networking and DevOps.

## 🌍 OSI Model (7 Layers)
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and describe network protocols and interactions. It consists of **seven layers**:

### **1️⃣ Physical Layer**
📌 **Function:** Deals with physical connectivity between devices, such as cables, connectors, and network interface cards (NICs).  
✅ **Example:** Ethernet cables (e.g., Cat 5e, Cat 6) used to connect computers in an office network.

### **2️⃣ Data Link Layer**
📌 **Function:** Manages data frames between devices on the same network segment.  
✅ **Example:** Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) protocol for communication between devices in a local network.

### **3️⃣ Network Layer**
📌 **Function:** Handles routing and forwarding of data packets across different networks.  
✅ **Example:** IP (Internet Protocol), which enables devices to find each other on different networks using IP addresses.

### **4️⃣ Transport Layer**
📌 **Function:** Manages end-to-end communication between devices, ensuring data reliability and error checking.  
✅ **Example:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures reliable data transmission over the internet, used by protocols like HTTP and FTP.

### **5️⃣ Session Layer**
📌 **Function:** Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between applications.  
✅ **Example:** NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) for managing sessions between computers in a Windows network.

### **6️⃣ Presentation Layer**
📌 **Function:** Handles data translation, encryption, and compression for the application layer.  
✅ **Example:** ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) encoding for text representation in email communication.

### **7️⃣ Application Layer**
📌 **Function:** Provides network services directly to end-users and applications.  
✅ **Example:** HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) used by web browsers to access websites.

## 🏛️ TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
The **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model** is the foundational protocol suite used for internet communications. It consists of **four layers**, which roughly correspond to some layers of the OSI model:

### **1️⃣ Link Layer (Network Interface Layer)**
📌 **Function:** Similar to OSI's Physical and Data Link layers, handles physical network communication.  
✅ **Example:** Ethernet protocol for local area networks (LANs).

### **2️⃣ Internet Layer**
📌 **Function:** Similar to OSI's Network Layer, handles addressing, routing, and packet forwarding.  
✅ **Example:** IP (Internet Protocol) for global addressing and routing on the internet.

### **3️⃣ Transport Layer**
📌 **Function:** Similar to OSI's Transport Layer, ensures reliable data transfer between devices.  
✅ **Example:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable, connection-oriented communication.

### **4️⃣ Application Layer**
📌 **Function:** Combines functions of OSI's Session, Presentation, and Application layers, providing services directly to end-user applications.  
✅ **Example:** HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web browsing.
